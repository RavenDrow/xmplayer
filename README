This is a fork of xmplayer by Ced2911 (and now the Libxenon team) with my own customizations.
My customizations, compared to original release, are at the moment (30/07/2012):

Initial:
-Quick fix: Subtitles stays on screen when playing a new video without subs, after exiting a video with subs
-Fixed: "Return to Gui" and starting a video leads to crash 
-Fixed: .avi files not playing after a .mkv, .mov or .mp4 file has been played 
This fix is done via mplayer.conf by adding:
[extension.avi]
demuxer=avi
-Added: "Restart" and "Shutdown" buttons 
-Added: "Subtitle Size" under Settings - Atm you can only change size before starting your first video, after that you need to restart before it takes effect
This is quite simple really, have 3 different fonts sizes from mplayerhq's site. This is temporary until the subscale can be implemented with subfont.ttf
-Vsync is now enabled by default (disable via Gui)

24/07/2012:
-Added: A "smart menu" that saves your last selection and path when exiting a menu or playing a video (using y and then exit!)

26/07/2012:
-Fixed: When entering a new folder "Item number/All item number" will not update until moving down on d-pad

29/07/2012:
-Fixed: When paused, the osd buttons (y, xbox, x) unpauses video, only "a" pauses/unpauses now
This is done by adding pausing_keep to the osd binds in mplayer's input.conf
-Changed: The page down icon now only shows, if there are at least more items than a page (10 items pr page) 
-Added: Resume-playback function: if you stop a video in the middle of playing, it will save last position and resume from there if desired. However right now you cannot resume the first video after starting xmplayer.. Working to find a fix. 

30/07/2012:
-Changed: the subtitle quick fix from initial commit has been updated, it looks more stable now

TODO:
-Change subtitle paths
-Show progress bar when paused (semi done, after pressing osd-button(y) the function doesn't work after)
-Fix bug: The D-pad is very buggy after playing a video, every 2nd time you go out and in a menu it won't respond, but the A and B buttons work fine
-Add support for more subtitle languages
-Make the mplayer's menu working functions available in the main osd, so it no longer will be needed
