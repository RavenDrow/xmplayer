These files are the current configuration files used in mplayer by xmplayer. When xmplayer is compiled
place these files in root\mplayer\ folder.

-Codecs.conf: is the config for codecs, don't touch!
-Config: is the user config file, check here to configure startup vsync and sub settings.
-Input.conf: binds for mplayer, can be changed, but not all mplayers commands are working.
.Menu.conf: binds for mplayers libmenu, osd now has access to the same settings. A bind
in input.conf needs to be "toggle menu" to access it.
-Mplayer.conf: mplayer config file, basically the same as config, but settings in config 
overshadows these. Don't touch!
